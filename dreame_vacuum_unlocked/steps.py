"""The step vocabulary a task is built from.

One schema, three consumers: the editor renders fields from it, the YAML view
serialises against it, and the export turns steps into Home Assistant service
calls. Keeping them from drifting apart is the whole reason this is data rather
than three hand-written translations.

Deliberately a closed vocabulary of movement primitives. A task is "drive
here, look there, photograph it" - not a general automation language. Anything
conditional belongs in the Home Assistant automation that starts the task.

Note `use_camera_session` on rotate_to_heading: the vacuum allows one camera
session at a time, so a turn that happens while a stream is open must not try
to open its own. The executor infers this from whether a stream is running,
and the export writes it out explicitly - otherwise exported YAML would turn
noisily where the task did not.
