"""The configuration file: tasks, tags and classifications.

These are *settings* - things a person authored and would reasonably want to
read, diff, back up and paste into a support thread. Frigate keeps that kind
of thing in one YAML file rather than a database, and for the same reasons it
lives here too.

What stays in SQLite (store.py) is everything that is *not* settings: the
device list the integration pushes, and the run history. Neither is authored,
both regenerate themselves, and mixing an append-only activity log into a file
someone hand-edits would be unpleasant.

Round-tripped with ruamel rather than PyYAML so that a comment someone wrote
survives a save made from the UI. Losing them would train people not to
annotate their config, which is most of the point of it being a file.

    Validated the same way a config file save is - config_store.validate
    covers the whole document, so a bad value here is reported the same way
    a bad value in the editor would be.

    Mutates a deep copy, not the live cache: `load()` hands back the same
    object every call until the file changes, so editing it in place and
    then failing validation would leave the rejected values sitting in
    memory - accepted by every reader, written to disk by none - until
    something else happened to invalidate the cache.
